# my-resume
Hello, my name is Kevin Fallas. 

I'm a Software Engineer who likes to learn new things every day. 
Here is a simple repo that contains my up-to-date resume. Maybe you see something you like in it and want to talk, if so, I'll be more than happy to answer any question that comes my way.

Resume uses the template [html-resume-template](https://github.com/keff6/html-resume-template) from my own repos. Design was inspired from a google search on the web.
